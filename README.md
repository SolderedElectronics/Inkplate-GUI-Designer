# Configuring Fonts

The GUI editor is capable of rendering fonts in an accurate way to how
Adafruit GFX will render them on an Inkplate device. Currently this is
only scaled appropriately for the Inkplate 6, but this can be extended.

To use custom fonts, place TTF fonts in the `fonts/` folder, and update
`fonts.css` to add references to them.
